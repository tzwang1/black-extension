# Introduction
We implemented anti-aliasing, depth of field, texture mapping, soft shadows, 
and handling a non-trivial compound object (cylinder).

# Discussion

## Basic shading and shadows
We implemented both hard and soft shadows. Hard shadows is implemented in Raytracer::computeShading,
while soft shadows is implementated in Raytracer::computeShadingSoft

## Texture mapping
Our main.cpp is separated into two functions, renderTexturedScene, which will render texture mapped images
objects (plane, sphere, cube), and renderNonTexturedScene, which will render the other part 2 features,
(Depth of field, anti-aliasing, softshadows, cylinder).

## Texture mapping
For texture mapping we added char pointers to the material struct to store the red, green, and blue values
of bitmaps we read in. We then map the coordinates in the bitmap to the object using U, V coordinates
that were specified in our object intersection code.

## Anti-aliasing
For anti-aliasing we split each pixel into a 5x5 grid and then shot a ray to a random point in each grid
then averaged the sum of all the values to get the pixel color.

## DOF
For depth of field we computed secondary rays based on the tutorial slides helper code. This essentially
simulates depth of field by randomly sampling within the aperture everytime a pixel is shaded.

## Non-trivial primitive shapes
Additional primitive scene objects in scene_object.cpp include sphere, cynlinder, and cube.
The equations, geometry, and implementation are inspired by https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1999/AGraphHCI/SMAG/node2.html#SECTION00023200000000000000

## Glossy reflection
We also implemented glossy reflection, using jitters and the code supplied in the tutorial slides.
First we constructed an orthogonal basis at intersection point, then sample from a hemisphere constrained
based on the roughness of a material, and finally me transform the sample to the world space using the orthogonal basis.
